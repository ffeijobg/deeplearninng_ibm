      " share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n",
      " software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n",
      " GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n",
      " any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n",
      " your programs, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n",
      " price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n",
      " have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n",
      " them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n",
      " want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n",
      " free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n",
      "\n",
      "   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n",
      " these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n",
      " certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n",
      " you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n",
      " gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n",
      " freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n",

      "   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n",
      " (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n",

      "\n",
      "   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n",
      " that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n",
      " authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n",

      "   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n",
      " modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n",
      " can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n",
      " protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n",
      " pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n",
      " use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n",
      " have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n",
      " products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n",
      " stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n",
      " of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n",
      " States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n",
      " software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n",
      " avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n",

      "   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n",

    "The neural network works in 5 stages: \n",
    "1. Forward pass\n",
    "    * The input **X** is multiplied by the weights **w1** and passed through the first layer, followed by the application of the sigmoid or ReLU activation function. This gives the output for the hidden layer.\n",
    "    * The output of the hidden layer is then passed through the second set of weights **w2** to compute the final output. Again, a sigmoid activation function is used to generate the final output **a2**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Error calculation\n",
    "    * The error is computed as the difference between the expected output **(d)** and the actual output **(a2)**.\n",
    "3. Backward pass\n",
    "    * **Output Layer**: The derivative of the sigmoid activation function is applied to the error, producing the gradient for the output layer **(da2)**. This is used to calculate how much the weights in the output layer need to be adjusted.\n",
    "    * **Hidden Layer**: The error is then propagated backward to the hidden layer. The gradient at the hidden layer **(da1)** is computed by taking the dot product of the transpose of the weights **(w2.T)** and the gradient from the output layer. The derivative of the activation function (sigmoid or ReLU) is used to adjust this error.\n",
    "4. Weights and bias updates\n",
    "    * After computing the **gradients (dz1, dz2)**, the **weights (w1, w2)** and **biases (b1, b2)** are updated using the **learning rate (lr)** and **the gradients**. The updates are done to minimize the error and improve the model’s predictions.\n",
    "5. Training:\n",
    "    * This entire process is repeated over many iterations **(epochs)**. During each epoch, the model adjusts its weights and biases to reduce the error. Over time, the network learns to approximate the XOR function.\n",
